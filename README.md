# ft_ssl
## This project includes 3 school 42 projects of Encryption and Security
## Here you need to implement the behavior of the original openssl
### In [the first project](https://github.com/Dude-Rocker/resources/blob/master/ft_ssl/ft_ssl_md5.en.pdf) (Cryptographic hashing algorithms) it is necessary to implement hash functions such as md5, sha256, etc.
few examples:

progress: complete

### In [the second project](https://github.com/Dude-Rocker/resources/blob/master/ft_ssl/ft_ssl_des.pdf) (symmetric encoding and encryption), you need to implement encryption functions such as base64, des, etc.

progress: underway

### In [the third project](https://github.com/Dude-Rocker/resources/blob/master/ft_ssl/ft_ssl_rsa.pdf) you need to implement command such as rsa, genrsa, etc.

progress: maybe in the near future
